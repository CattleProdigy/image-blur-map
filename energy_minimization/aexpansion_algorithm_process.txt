==Blur Coherent Labeling Process==
* Candidate ML estimate values vectors are convolved with 1D linear filter at each pixel
* -log of estimate vectors are taken at each pixel
* Image/filtered ML candidates are pixel serialized as [row 1 row2 row 3 ... row M]
	- Result is 1xNMx#labels array
* 2nd order neighborhood sparse matrix is constructed using upper left triangular
	pairwise potentials (NMxNM sparse matrix) with 4 non-zero relationships per row
* Unary cost set to ML estimate vector
* Alpha expansion performed with neighborhood smoothness and unary costs
* Approx. optimal labeling given the discrete space of blur parameters is given
